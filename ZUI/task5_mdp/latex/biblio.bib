% V: this is just an example of a bibliography file


% V: this is a random article I had in my bibliography just to show the formating of the bibliography entry. You usually do not need to format such entries manually. I often use https://www.doi2bib.org/ which generates the bib entry from the DOI of the paper or you can use Mendeley library manager https://www.mendeley.com/ (with suitable plugin for bib entries).
